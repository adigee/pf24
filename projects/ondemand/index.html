                    Unbabel was designed to be an invisible B2B translation layer for customer support. Following the acquisition of Lingo24, we needed to migrate their localisation customers to our platform — which meant completely overhauling On-demand to support an entirely new use-case.

        <p class="section-text">
            Unbabel was designed to be an invisible B2B translation layer for customer support. Our integrations seamlessly fit into a customer's existing support CRM to intercept and translate customer support messages.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            To migrate Lingo24 customers to our platform, we would need to support their primary use-case — Localisation. This meant developing brand new features and workflows for a translation industry use-case that we didn't support comprehensively.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            More than 90% of existing customers would use Unbabel via integrations. Since On-demand was the only customer-facing touchpoint for requesting translations, it became the ideal touchpoint for both existing and new customers to translate files.

    <!-- Approach -->
    <section class="project-section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Approach</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Our plan was two-fold — release an improved On-demand v2 for existing customers; then evolve into On-demand v3 for migrating localisation customers.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            I partnered with 2 product managers — one from my team and the other building the underlying file translation API — to plan the project, align roadmaps and create a UX research plan to learn about Localisation customer needs. I had parachuted into this team for this project, so my process involved multiple moments of collaboration, participation, and design reviews to earn their trust and create empathy in the team for the migrating customers.

    <!-- Design Explorations -->
    <section class="project-section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Design Explorations</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            On-demand v1 had a year-long backlog of feature requests and bugs. Due to unexpected volume of usage, customers were struggling to track, find and retrieve their translation orders. I had studied the backlog and already identified the primary reported customer needs — this helped me understand where the team was and how far we could go.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            I created multiple explorations of how we could introduce search functionality to On-demand. Divergent explorations helped the team understand the trade-offs involved in terms of experience vs the technical constraints. Including engineers in these activities was crucial in teasing out the constraints of our front-end framework and the underlying API.

    <!-- Final Design -->
    <section class="project-section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Final Design</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            We decided to invest in building a new component for filters and updating the design system. The existing components for tables and filters were clunky and lacking in quality. Improving it would raise the UX across the board on the platform — and demonstrating this value helped get the buy-in needed to invest in a higher quality experience.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            Since the underlying API systems were being overhauled, the lifecycle of a file translation order changed as well. This provided the perfect opportunity to review and improve the customer-facing email templates. I also defined the instrumentation plan to start embedding analytics sensors in this micro-app moving forward.

    <!-- UX Research -->
    <section class="project-section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">UX Research</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            To learn about the customers we were going to migrate, I planned and executed a research track to start building our in-house knowledge about localisation.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            I started by analysing the existing Lingo24 interface for uploading complex files and used it as a starting point to develop a lo-fi prototype of how On-demand could accommodate it on our platform.

    <!-- Research Synthesis -->
    <section class="project-section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Research Synthesis</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            I recruited and moderated sessions with 8 customers who represented more than 70% of the total translation volume of Lingo24 customers. These sessions had a mixed method structure — starting with exploration of their workflows to uncover how they worked with files, then ending with evaluation of my lo-fi prototype.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            Using this approach, I was able to fast-track to actionable customer inputs and help shape how the product org understood this new use-case.

    <!-- On-demand v3 — Projects -->
    <section class="project-section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">On-demand v3 — Projects</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Armed with these insights, I designed the next version of On-demand which was eventually rebranded to Projects. In essence, a project was a group of orders that shared the same translation configurations.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            Key features of On-demand v3 (Projects): multi-file upload, pre-defined templates for translation orders, and a foundation for more complex functionalities like price estimates and DTP.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            The primary challenge throughout was the organisational dynamics — 3 teams, half from a newly acquired organisation, with rampant differences in opinion. As the only product designer on an initiative of over 20 people, my work received a great deal of scrutiny. By creating many demos, checkpoints and holding participatory sessions, I was successful in bringing the entire team on board to build a future-forward customer experience for existing and migrating customers.
