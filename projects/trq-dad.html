        <div class="project-section-inner">
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Challenge</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                Filing an insurance claim after a car accident is stressful and confusing. People are often in shock or distress after an accident, traditional claim forms are complex and intimidating, and users don't know what information is required.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Mobile form-filling at an accident scene is difficult, and missing information leads to claim delays. We needed to design a solution that worked in this challenging context.
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Solution Section -->
    <section class="project-section">
        <div class="project-section-inner">
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Solution</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                I designed a conversational chatbot that guides users through the claims process step-by-step, asking simple questions and providing contextual help. The bot uses natural, empathetic language appropriate for the situation and breaks down complex forms into simple, single-question interactions.

        <div class="project-section-inner">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Design Process</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                I interviewed recent accident victims and insurance agents to understand the emotional and practical challenges of the claims process. Using service blueprinting, I mapped the entire claim journey from accident to resolution, identifying touchpoints and pain points.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                I crafted the chatbot dialogue to be empathetic, clear, and efficient, testing multiple conversation flows with users. The visual design needed to be clean and accessible, optimized for mobile use in potentially challenging conditions.

        <div class="project-section-inner">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Key Features</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                The solution included location detection with integrated maps to help users pinpoint the accident location accurately without typing addresses. Users could take photos of damage and submit them directly within the conversation flow.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Clear visual feedback showed progress through the process, while empathetic language acknowledged the stressful situation while keeping the process moving forward.

    <!-- Impact Section -->

        <div class="project-section-inner">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Impact</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                The chatbot resulted in a 67% reduction in average claim filing time and an 89% completion rate for mobile submissions (versus 34% for traditional forms). Incomplete claims were reduced from 42% to 12%.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                User feedback showed positive sentiment about the experience, and the project won a service design award in Portugal.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Learnings</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                This project deepened my understanding of service design and designing for emotional contexts. The conversational interface wasn't just a technical choice—it fundamentally changed how customers experienced a stressful moment.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Small details like the empathetic language and visual progress indicators had outsized impacts on completion rates and user satisfaction. I also learned the importance of cross-functional collaboration—working closely with insurance domain experts helped me understand legal requirements while the service designer helped me map the broader ecosystem.
